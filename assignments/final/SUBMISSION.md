## After the Credits — Group Project Integration

Working on **After the Credits** as part of our group project has been an incredible learning experience. This project gave me the chance to collaborate closely with teammates and contribute to a full-stack web application that movie lovers can use to discover, rate, and discuss films.

### What I Learned

- **Team collaboration:** Coordinating with team members from frontend, backend, UI/UX, and data roles helped me understand the importance of clear communication and dividing responsibilities. Everyone brought unique skills, and it was exciting to see how our individual contributions formed a cohesive product.

- **UI/UX & Interactivity:** My role focused on JavaScript interactivity, including building the star rating system,watchlist and client-side form validation. I enjoyed tackling real world usability challenges like providing instant feedback and accessible controls.

- **Integrating projects:** Adding the group project into my personal portfolio website gave me practical experience managing project structure, navigation consistency, and deployment on GitHub Pages. Making sure everything was linked properly and functioned well across devices pushed me to sharpen my testing and debugging skills.

- **Full-stack development awareness:** Even though my focus was frontend interactivity, I gained appreciation for backend workflows and database design through team discussions and reviewing the README and routes. It reinforced how important a solid backend is for a seamless user experience.

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the challenges I faced was ensuring smooth deployment on Render, especially handling routing and API calls correctly and logging in with csrf protection I had to troubleshoot issues when csrf protection was working on my local machine but I was getting an error in render. I also struggled when my session were not being registered on the webiste while they were valid in my terminal. 

### Final Thoughts

Overall, this project has been a rewarding capstone to the semester. It combined technical skills, teamwork, and problem-solving in a way that feels very close to real-world software development. I’m proud of the product we built and grateful for the chance to contribute to such a meaningful and polished application.

Thank you to my team members and instructors for all their support and feedback throughout this journey!
