I want a CSS stylesheet for my portfolio website that follows a clean, modern UI design. I’ve attached an image that shows the general style I’m looking for.  

Here’s what I want:  
- A light mode theme with a white background and soft blue accents.  
- A clean, minimalistic navigation bar with simple hover effects.  
- A card-style layout for the "Projects" section with soft shadows.  
- Rounded buttons with smooth hover animations.  
- A fixed header that stays visible while scrolling.  
- The contact form should have a stylish, easy-to-read design with input fields that change color slightly when focused.  
- Subtle animations for elements when they first appear on the screen.  

The design should feel fresh, modern, and easy to navigate, inspired by the attached reference image.
