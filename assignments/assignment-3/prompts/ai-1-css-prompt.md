I need a modern and clean CSS stylesheet for my portfolio website. It should look professional but also simple and easy to read.  

Here’s what I want:  
- A dark blue and white color scheme.  
- A nice Google Font combo (maybe Poppins for headings and Roboto for body text).  
- A responsive design that looks good on both desktop and mobile (use flexbox and media queries).  
- A navigation menu that stays clean and easy to use on all screen sizes.  
- Smooth hover effects on buttons and links.  
- A subtle fade-in animation when sections load.  
- A contact form that looks neat with styled inputs and a nice submit button.  

I want the overall design to feel modern, but not too flashy—just something clean, readable, and professional.
