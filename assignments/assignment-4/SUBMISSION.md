### Description:
For this assignment, I created a JavaScript calculator with a UI mimicking the iOS/Android calculator. The calculator includes essential functionalities such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and supports keyboard input. It is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. I used DOM manipulation to update the calculatorâ€™s display and handle user input via both buttons and the keyboard. Event handling was implemented for button clicks, and I also utilized ES6+ features such as arrow functions and template literals to streamline the code.

### Challenges Faced:
One of the main challenges was implementing keyboard support. I had to ensure that both keyboard and mouse inputs were handled seamlessly. After extensive testing, I overcame this challenge by using `keydown` and `keyup` event listeners to properly map the keys to the calculator functions. Ensuring a smooth experience across various devices also required thorough adjustments to the CSS for responsiveness.

### Additional Features:
- Added a "Clear" button to reset the calculator.
- Implemented a decimal point for floating-point calculations.
- Improved UI responsiveness for mobile and tablet views.
